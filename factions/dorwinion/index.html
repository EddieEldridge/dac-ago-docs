Both of these natural features provide Dorwinion some protection from their Easterling neighbours. They begin with their capital; The Garden City (Caras Sant), the castle of the Western Gardens (Sant Annui) and the City of the Coastal Folk (Strondost).</p><h3 id=campaign-events>Campaign Events</h3><ul><li><p>The premise is Dale is asking for help to rebuild now that they feel the threat of the Easterlings, the council wants to help them while the nobles and merchants want to keep their profits.</p><ul><li>Accepting will give you a significant kings purse loss, normal replenishment rate for elves, access to top tier smithing, construction time reduced faction wide, instant war with Rhun and some rebellious Nobles in your heartlands.</li><li>Declining will give you great trade bonuses, half replenishment for elves and so-so relations with both Dale and Rhun (Rhun will probably still attack you, this is not an evil/good choice, but the player does have a chance to choose to go evil if he tries to ally them with a tempting offer during this time period) and construction costs reduced faction wide</li></ul></li><li><p>As a mostly mercenary faction you will have low amounts of free upkeep units.</p></li></ul><h3 id=early-game>Early Game</h3><p>There are plenty of independent towns and castles in the wide grasslands of Rhovanion and Logathavuld that Dorwinion can easily claim before they need resort to all out war. The Darïtaï of Rhûn, being Dorwinion&rsquo;s nearest neighbour, start on neutral terms with the lands of wine and may not bring conflict in the early game. Beyond the Easterlings, the men of Dale and the Dwarves of Erebor hold as steadfast allies to the north.</p><h3 id=military-overview>Military Overview</h3><p>Dorwinion have a unique military that depends upon the choices their ruling council and Vine-Regent take, predominantly though they are a medium-armoured infantry faction, with good ranged units and lots of variety. They have some solid cavalry and if the Elves are brought to bear, they have some formidable elite troops.</p><h4 id=leofthiuda>Leofthiuda</h4><ul><li>Numerous Northmen-Balchoth Clans. Live in the plains all around Dorwinion, behind the river. Pastoralists, though many also grow wheat and barley.</li></ul><h4 id=kugath>Kugath</h4><ul><li>Wainrider descendant clans, mainly herders, live in small, mobile clans, often driving wagons and wains. Live near Rhun in the area between the mountains and the sea of Rhun. Present also in Rhun.</li></ul><h4 id=rouadengi>Rouadengi</h4><ul><li>Dwellers of the trading towns of Dorwinion, a people related to both old Rhovanion, Dale and even Gondor. Make up the urban elite of the society, are the richest, upper class has extensive and wide ranging vineyards. Capitol houses the Vintner Court.</li></ul><h3 id=special-features>Special Features</h3><ul><li>Human & Elven Choice</li></ul><h3 id=rare-units>Rare Units</h3><ul><li>Kugath War-Wains</li><li>Regents Redwood-Bows</li><li>Rouadengi Citizen-Guard</li></ul><h3 id=gallery>Gallery</h3><script src=/shortcode-gallery/jquery-3.6.0.min.js></script>

id=units>Units</h3><h3>Units owned by byzantium (31 found)</h3><table class=units-table><thead><tr><th>Unit Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Athala Rangers</td><td>The Athala nobles are the lifeline between the ancient fallen kingdom of Rhovanion and their descendants in the Kingdom of Dale. While the Rangers of Ithilien operate from the west of the Anduin, the rangers of Rhovanion operate through Mirkwood and as far as the Iron Hills. It was from the Rangers that Bard the Bowman emerged to defeat Smaug the dragon, it is also from the ranks of these guardians that the nobles and best warriors of the Kingdom of Dale are recruited. For over 20 generations these Rangers have kept alive the memory of the old ways, wandering Wilderland, carrying messages between man, elf and dwarf, as well as scouting against the dark enemy.\n\nRECRUITABLE FROM EAST-MIRKWOOD TO DORWINION</td></tr><tr><td>Avari Shadows</td><td>\nRefusers. Those who shunned the call. Deep in lantern-lit caves and brooding forests, in meadows untouched by man since the days of Cuiviénen, there dwell the Avari. They are a wild breed, less sophisticated than their kinfolk that heeded the Valar, and they are jealous guardians of their hidden places. Men that do try to cross the threshold are found cut, or feathered by long-shafted gracile arrows. The Avari are not interested in becoming part of any realm, nor will they be subjects of any lord not of their own. They keep their own counsel in all things.\n\nBut perhaps a wise and cunning lord of men - and what else is the ruler of Dorwinion - may convince them that to support his cause in war against the realms enemies, furthers also their own goal of remaining unmolested and alone in their forest homes, that to do so would ensure no mannish intrusions into their secret places? If such an accord could be reached, these elven warriors would bring the might of the refusers to the battle, and though their armor may be light, and their weapon-craft less sophisticated than that of the Noldor - these Elves make up for it in wildness and ferocity.\n\nThe Avari were never tempered by the gentle touch of Illuvatars children, and it shows. They wage war with a merciless obsession, firing vicious barbed arrows and then closing in with terrible, cleaver-like elven swords.</td></tr><tr><td>Avari Spearmen</td><td>But perhaps a wise and cunning lord of men - and what else is the ruler of Dorwinion - may convince them that to support his cause in war against the realms enemies, furthers also their own goal of remaining unmolested and alone in their forest homes, that to do so would ensure no mannish intrusions into their secret places?

They wage war with a merciless obsession, firing vicious barbed arrows and then closing in with terrible, cleaver-like elven swords.</td></tr><tr><td>Avarin Héruvi</td><td>These elves are the lords of the Avari; the leaders of those that refused. They fight clad in leather and scale, adorned with leafs and precious stones and feathers. Before they close into melee with their war-Glaives, they engage the enemy with their bows - complex and marvelous weapons, that fire arrows with such speed, power and accuracy that no armor seems sufficient, as these warriors will simply shoot the gaps.</td></tr><tr><td>Black Uruks</td><td>Black Uruks are a larger, more powerful breed of orcs, much stronger and more resilient than their lesser cousins, though not nearly as numerous. Clad in heavy armour plates over chain mail and leather, Uruk infantry serve as brutal frontline soldiers, smashing into the ranks of the enemy at the forefront of the Dark Lord Sauron's attacks, hacking wildly at the enemy with their sword and parrying enemy attacks with their stout shield.</td></tr><tr><td>Council Wardens</td><td>The Vintner-Court is the ruling body of Dorwinion, and the number of its members is exceptional. Unlike the courts of Gondor or Arnor, nobility is not a requirement to join. Instead, the key to join its ranks is simple, personal wealth. As such, most of its members are Rouadengi, though there are many Léofthiuda clan-chiefs who find their ways into the corridor of power. Even Kugathi nobles occasionally climb to this position.\n\nEvery Vintner-member has a vote, and once a man has achieved membership of the Court, they retain it for life, even should he be rendered destitute and become too poor to fit amidst their ranks. Though, in these cases, their vote on fiscal matters would be rescinded, as it is ill fitting for a man who could not hold onto their wealth, to decide how others should use theirs.Whenever the Vintner-Court sends out one of their own for military matters, they ensure he is accompanied by a personal bodyguard.\nThese men carry the sigil of whatever party sponsored them, wearing it proudly on their armour. As they are sponsored by the wealthiest men of the realm, said armour truly is the envy of others, and the same goes for the rest of their equipment.\n\nGilded lamellar fastened by silken string, silvered helmets, cloth dyed in the most expensive colours and weapons made by the finest smiths, these men have it all, and they deserve it! Each member of the bodyguard is a champion, a veteran mercenary hired for life, or a member of the court exceptionally skilled in battle, and all of them train relentlessly to further hone their skills.These men will protect the general with all their martial prowess, and even with their own lives should there be a need for it.\n\nYet while a man protected by such a powerful ring of steel seems mighty, he would do well to remember that should the Vintner-Court find him to be failing in his task, his champions would just as quickly turn their blades inward instead, the bodyguards becoming jailers.</td></tr><tr><td>Farmhand Volunteers</td><td>In the troubling times that afflict Middle-earth, none are spared from the selection of warriors to hold back the tide of enemies seeking to wipe each other out or claim dominion over all the lands. These simple farmhands are one such group of humans who will need to fight to defend their lands. Unlike other farmers of Middle-earth and lesser peasantry, these men work solely with livestock and this gives them a hardier constitution and as such, they are capable warriors. Wearing light leather armour under their farming attire, they are swift, agile and hardy but cursed with appealing morale.</td></tr><tr><td>Regents Grapevine-Lancers</td><td>Their equipment is a compromise - whilst they are not as heavily armored as the Cataphracts of Rhûn, they still handily outclass all other cavalry they are likely to go up against.\n\nAdditionally, these men are not fearful of a protracted melee, should the battles needs call for it.</td></tr><tr><td>Longship</td><td>Longships have been in use by the men of Middle-earth for many centuries. Lacking the knowledge of the ocean that the Númenóreans brought out of the west, the lesser men rely on these simple oar powered boats to ferry troops up and down the great rivers of Middle-earth. When pressed into battle these simple vessels attempt to ram one another or rely on archer fire from the deck.</td></tr><tr><td>Kugathi Rátha</td><td>\nThe Rátha or "Wains", as they are known in the West, are beautifully crafted chariots of war. With a focus on speed and manoeuvrability, they bear upon their finely crafted chassis the Chieftains of the Kugathi people. Wielding enourmous bows crafted from a special type of birch only found in their native lands, they can obliterate targets from an extremely long range. However, due to the larger bow size and accompanying arrows, there is limited capacity for more than a dozen volleys. The Kugath are the last and least of the three folk, often seen by the other two as cousins rather than brothers. Their tribe dwells in the rocky hills and the flatlands that lay couched between the Ered Dorwin and the sea, living at the very border with Rhûn. They are descendants of Wainriders and Easterlings, their traditions harking back to a time that has long passed in other realms. Their chiefs stand proudly on elaborate chariots, wielding huge bows, while their people live in mobile wains. The Kugath, though often seeing the men of the East as relatives rather than ancestral foes, none the less serve the Court with sufficient loyalty.\n\n The Ford-Guard protect and keep vigil on the various streams, rivers and fords that flow down from the Mountains of Dorwinion. Armed with wicker shields and short, sharp spears, they provide the first warning signs of an invasion and help to screen the enemy's advance.</td></tr><tr><td>Kugath Ford-Guard</td><td>\nThe Kugath are the last and least of the three folk, often seen by the other two as cousins rather than brothers.

Their chiefs stand proudly on elaborate chariots, wielding huge bows, while their people live in mobile wains. The Kugath, though often seeing the men of the East as relatives rather than ancestral foes, none the less serve the Court with sufficient loyalty.\n\nThe Runners serve as messengers and scouts, being able to traverse ground that the chariots of their nobles cannot cover. Rather than engaging in melee, the Runners serve as highly mobile and capable archers.</td></tr><tr><td>Leofthiuda Clanband</td><td>The Léofthiuda are the most populous of the three groups, a purely Northmannish tribe, making them one of the few left in Rhovanion. Most herd cattle and some rear fine horses, while many others toil on the Vintner Barons' expansive estates. They largely live as once did the Rohirrim's ancestors, meaning they learn to ride at the same time as they learn how to walk.\n\nThe Clanband, who make up the rank and file of the Leofthiuda clans, are called up to fight for the more urbanite Rouadengi when the horns of war are heard from the coasts. They are fast, lightly armoured and weild javelins to make up for their lack of proper military training.</td></tr><tr><td>Leofthiuda Far-riders</td><td>\nThe Léofthiuda are the most populous of the three groups, a purely Northmannish tribe, making them one of the few left in Rhovanion. Most herd cattle and some rear fine horses, while many others toil on the Vintner Barons' expansive estates. They largely live as once did the Rohirrim's ancestors, meaning they learn to ride at the same time as they learn how to walk.\n\nThe Far-Riders scout the borders of Leofthiuda territory in search of new plains and pastures to settle on. They are experienced cavalrymen but lightly armored and a wise commander would do well to utilize their manoeuvrability and speed over any attempt at a frontal attack.</td></tr><tr><td>Leofthiuda Retainers</td><td>The Léofthiuda are the most populous of the three groups, a purely Northmannish tribe, making them one of the few left in Rhovanion. Most herd cattle and some rear fine horses, while many others toil on the Vintner Barons' expansive estates. They largely live as once did the Rohirrim's ancestors, meaning they learn to ride at the same time as they learn how to walk.\n\n The Retainers eak out a living offering their services to the various lords of and ladies of Dorwinion, Rouadengi, Kugath, Leofthiuda, it does not matter. What matters is that their families are fed and one day they can hopefully return to their homeland alive and well.</td></tr><tr><td>Minas Ithil Guardians</td><td>With the Morgul Vale cleansed of the foul taint of the Úlari and their servants the Tower of the Moon once again stands ready to protect Gondor from the shadow. Stationed at Minas Ithil are the newly formed Guardians. Recruited from the ranks of veterans that have fought against the hosts of the dark lord, these men have taken a vow to stand vigilant against the shadow and to protect the Tower of the Moon for the awaited return of the king. Armed and armoured with the very best gear from Gondor’s armouries, these soldiers fight in highly disciplined ranks of heavy swordsmen. Proudly wearing tabards that show the new symbol of Minas Ithil – the moon and tree, and ready to lay down their lives in the defence of Gondor; these men will fight to the very end. With the defence of the newly named Minas Ithil an absolute priority, these men have been known to fight under the banner of other forces of good in order to protect the Vale.\n\nREQUIRES MINAS ITHIL</td></tr><tr><td>Orc Host</td><td>Orc soldiers, fearful of day, thriving at night. They are brutal and bloodthirsty, both traits exemplified in their love of fighting. Orc warriors wield a mix of axes, swords and whatever else they can find to kill with. A rag-tag assortment of scavenged or orc-smithed armour serves to protect these vicious fighters. Though lacking in training and poorly equipped compared to most human soldiers Orcs will rely on numbers and sheer savagery to overwhelm their foes.</td></tr><tr><td>Orc Maulers</td><td>Orc soldiers, fearful of day, thriving at night. They are brutal and bloodthirsty, both traits exemplified in their love of fighting. Orc two-handers wield a mix of axes, hammers and whatever else they can find to kill with. A rag-tag assortment of scavenged or orc-smithed armour serves to protect these vicious fighters. Their weapons, though cumbersome, are brutally effective at shattering armour or cleaving the heads from the necks of their opponents.</td></tr><tr><td>Regents Thornstaffers</td><td>The Vintner Court was originally founded by land-owning merchants, men who chiefly grew and then sold wine - hence the name, though the institution of today is a vastly more complex beast than it was at its inception. Dorwinions armies have never been made up of professional, full-time soldiers, but were ever an amalgam of the forces of the separate people making up the realm itself.\n\nThe various councilors would debate and argue, some would agree to send a portion of their men, some wouldn’t, and eventually an armed force would materialize.\n\nA fine system, for a regional power of little import, interested mainly in self defense and driven by the inherent need of all men for the riches of others when on the offense.\n\nNo more. With the final city conquered, the Sea of Rhun is now the Sea of Vines, encircled by purple tendrils reaching all the the way from Helcârin to Mistrand.\n\nWith such power and wealth at their back and call, the position of Regent has expanded substantially in authority. Now, by Regents decree, the courts coffers pay for the equipment and training of men, drawn from all the cities and villages that sit on the coast of the sea, men who are under arms all year round, and ready to fight whenever called upon. Advisors from other realms have been paid to help organize this reform.\n\nThis new force is split into three branches, of infantry, archers, and cavalry, inspired by their old rhunic adversary. This step marks Dorwinions evolution into a polity truly able to effectively project its power outward, and both friend and foe should be wary of shrewd merchants with such a force at their command.\nThese warriors bear staff weapons, to be used to stab and slash, and they wield them with the skill and confidence only long months of continuous drill instill in a man.\n\nTheir armor is well made, with good iron, and crafted by Council-sponsored smiths, and whilst the initial Reform sees these soldiers wear gambeson beneath their cuirasses, chainmail will replace it in time.\n\nThe Thornstaffers are intended as the vanguard of this new force, presenting a wall of points towards the enemy, grinding them down in a constant forward march.</td></tr><tr><td>Regents Redwood-Bows</td><td>The Redwood Bowmen are armed with strong and sturdy bows, weapons which are painted red, giving this branch of the reformed army its name.\n\nThese men are not gifted with elven eyes, and their bows are not of steel, but aside from that, few ranged warriors near or far can compete with them.\n\nTraining relentlessly in their court-funded barracks, these men enter the battlefield able to out-shoot most of their eastern counterparts - and any mounted archers - and come equipped with long swords and bucklers, allowing them to enter any melee with confidence.</td></tr><tr><td>Rouadengi Citizen Guard</td><td>The coastal cities of the Rouadengi, the most prosperous of the peoples of Dorwinion, arm and train a good number of their lower-class citizenry, turning them into a competent and surprisingly motivated militia force. While the Thornguard are comprised of men serving in a more official capacity, often being sent far from their home cities to fulfill the wishes of the Vintner-Regent, the Citizen Guard are more akin to a local militia or peacekeeping force. Their actual military training is somewhat lacking but they make up for it in their loyalty and discipline. As an extension of the Vintner-Regent's mailed fist, these men patrol the streets day and night during times of war, maintaining order and keeping a keen eye out for any who would undermine the Regent's authority. Few rebellions have begun from the rousing speech of a man with no hands.</td></tr><tr><td>Rouadengi Thorn Piercers</td><td>The coastal cities of the Rouadengi, the most prosperous of the peoples of Dorwinion, arm and train a good number of their lower-class citizenry, turning them into a competent and surprisingly motivated militia force. These semi-professionals carry the proud name of Thornguard, and are divided in two specific groups. Those in possession of enough affluence to afford strong swords and good shields, are known as the Shieldbearers, whereas the others, who are provided with maces and crossbows, each engraved with a small grapevine, find themselves under the banner of the Thornguard Piercers.\n\nWhilst most of the full time soldiery of the Rouadengi serve in the Navy, a man serving in the city militia still holds a prestigious position. It is not uncommon for these men to spend a goodly amount of their income on the beautification of their equipment, adorning it with the crest of the city they serve, or a noble or merchant house they are linked with. Unlike most militia, these men take pride in serving their city, and see their task not just as a duty, but as an honour.\n\nAs such, no foe should make the mistake of disregarding these men as mere peasant rabble, forced away from a fruitful harvest to be reaped by the sickle of war. For they are tenacious fighters, and though they lack the staying power and prowess of true professionals, they are still a dependable and surprisingly potent force.</td></tr><tr><td>Rouadengi Thorn Shieldbearers</td><td>The coastal cities of the Rouadengi, the most prosperous of the peoples of Dorwinion, arm and train a good number of their lower-class citizenry, turning them into a competent and surprisingly motivated militia force.

Indeed names are only given if the unit has proven themselves in a great feat of war of if they come to be feared enough by their enemies that they have nicknamed them. Therefore, it is a foolish commander who fights against the ranks of 'Sauron's Will' and doesn't have the best of the best with him! Heavily armoured and armed with an horrific array of fierce two-handed weapons, that they wield as if they were a child's wooden sword, these Uruks have rightly earned the name of Sauron's Will as when they fight, his will is done! They are best used as shock troops, routing enemies in almighty charges but can equally hold their own in prolonged combat. Their fighting prowess and renown drew the attention of the Mouth of Sauron and he moved their garrison to Barad-dûr where he took personal command of them, thus protecting the Dark Tower with the very best of Mordor's savage ranks.\n\nREQUIRES BARAD-DÛR, MORANNON OR MINAS MORGUL</td></tr><tr><td>Temple Knights</td><td>These dark descendants of ancient Númenor represent the worst humanity has to offer. Strong, ruthless and ambitious these Númenóreans succumbed to the same weakness of spirit that plagues all of mankind. They gave themselves to Sauron in exchange for power but have only gained hatred and emptiness. After the War of the Last Alliance their numbers dwindled, but even now, after three thousand years, they rise again fuelled by their pride and unquenchable hatred of Gondor. When stepping onto the battlefield the Black Númenóreans leave no doubt about their thoughts and intentions. Led by the Witch-king and advancing in imposing black armour, their faces covered by cruel iron masks, the Black Númenóreans resemble cold executioners as they massacre the enemy ranks with fearsome charges and great swords. These harbingers of death and darkness are a true terror weapon that only the very bravest can hope to stand against.</td></tr><tr><td>Temple Wards</td><td>When the power of Númenor was firmly held by Sauron in his role as chief advisor, he began construction of the infamous 'Temple'. A monstrous worship space, dedicated to Melkor, in the heart of the Númenórean capital of Armenelos. The Temple fell when the island was drowned by The One but the memory of the colossal structure lives on in the descendants of the fell Númenóreans who emigrated to Middle-earth before the Downfall. These Black soldiers now take up the name of the Temple as their war cry as they march across Middle-earth in the name of Sauron the Deceiver! The numbers of these Wards are very few however they are the pinnacle of Sauron's warriors. Indeed, a few Wards accompany every orc battalion into war but when gathered into their own battle group they are more than a match for any Gondorian pretender.</td></tr><tr><td>Vinefleet Mariners</td><td>The realm of the Vintner-Court is fundamentally one of of traders and merchants, of businessmen and shrewd hagglers. Wealth is the measure of a man, and a well-stocked treasury can buy almost anything in Dorwinions coastal cities and towns. The Sea of Rhun is the place whence this coveted wealth flows from - or rather from the red-sailed ships of the Vinefleet. Initially, the fleet was called such due to its nature - its holds were overwhelmingly filled with the produce of the vintner barons and their large vineyards. Today the fleet sails around the coast of the sea of Rhun, stopping in Neburkha, then all the way to Esgaroth, from where huge caravans of merchants set out to the woodland realm, or to yet more distant destinations.\n\nBut to keep this fleet secure, and to safeguard against the predations of pirates, corsairs and other such maritime filth - and to protect the many harbors of the dorwinionite coast - there need to be men skilled in a different trade than their merchant employers.\n\nThe Mariners are those men. All other men under arms in the realm, bear those same arms only temporarily. The Thornguard when duty calls, the nobles when the the fancy takes them. The Mariners practice all year round, live on their ships, and are of cut-throat nature that few can rival. Anyone may join, be he commoner, Eastron exile, or noble son - as long as they can complete the rigorous trials successfully - but whoever joins, does so for life. The merchant guilds pay these men handsomely - in addition to the loot they “liberate” from the holds of vanquished pirates, and it shows. “Mariner” is a byword for flamboyance and gaudy behavior, with their elaborately crested helmets, heavily decorated shields and expensively colored cloth.\n\nIn battle, these men show no mercy, any doubts as to their effectiveness, any hope of the enemy that these peacocks are merely overdressed and effeminate nobles viciously cut and broken apart by the devastating barrage of lead-weighted javelins and the subsequent strikes of brutal boarding axes.</td></tr><tr><td>Rouadengi Vintner-Court Nobles</td><td>Cynical folk of other lands might think that the noble born of Dorwinion are more suited for sipping wine and too pampered to ever see a battle. They would be grossly mistaken, for these men understand that their wealth and titles are bound to the lands the own, the people who serve them.\n\nAs such; the nobility are often the fiercest warriors in the Dorwinion army, for they are driven not only by the desire to protect their interests, but also their responsibility to the families who work their lands. How could the people be expected to fight if their rulers do not also shoulder the burdens of war?\n\nWith their considerable wealth these men can also afford the very best equipment and training. Some can even purchase custom arms and armor of Dwarven or Elven design. Sporting two-handed axes and swords, they cleave into the enemy ranks with a zealous fury that only those born to rule can unleash.</td></tr><tr><td>Ballista</td><td>These artillery pieces resemble giant crossbows on a simple wheeled carriage. They can hurl javelins with great accuracy, and the power of these machines means that their bolts can pierce any armour.</td></tr><tr><td>Catapult</td><td>Constructed of wood and capable of flinging stones large enough to crush a man's head, the catapult is a common sight on the battlefields of Middle-earth.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></main></div></body></html>

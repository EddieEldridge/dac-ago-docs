Divide and Conquer: AGO is an overhaul of the Divide and Conquer mod.

Without you, none of this would have been possible.

I would just like to say thank you to everyone in the Third Age/DaC/AGO communities for always being pleasant, providing excellent feedback and advice. Working with the rest of the developers and within the community has been extremely fun and fulfilling and it wouldn't have been so without the community. Keep on being you :) - Medik

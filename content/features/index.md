- Completely overhauled campaign AI with a focus on different faction/culture specific behaviour
- Aggression, how likely to betray depends on what kind of faction it is.
- Allies help way more, they will often come to relieve a siege on one of your settlements
- Overhauled diplomacy and faction standings.
    - AA start neutral to everyone even as AI, but they generally dislike everyone and hate the Dunedain nations and Mordor
    - Made it basically impossible for the most lore breaking ceasefires/alliances/wars to happen.
    - Factions that hate you often decline trade rights and map info
- Overhauled economy, cities make more money than castles, generally a lot less income from taxes and boosted income from trading, farming and mining (basically making getting economy buildings and capturing trading settlements more important).
- Pace has been slowed down overall allowing for longer campaigns where you try to complete the victory conditions without fighting endless spam from huge nations late game
- Difference between castles and cities is way bigger, castles replenish troops faster while making way less money than cities
- Battle AI Overhaul, Increased the health of gates/walls making it harder to capture settlements, better Battle AI that defends the gates/walls, sallies when getting shot and flanks.
- Removed focus on capturing plaza, AI knows this as well and focuses on fighting you instead of defending/attacking plaza.
- AI sits outside the range of towers until the gate is broken.
- Redone win conditions, with more lore-accurate targets.
- Removed barracks event and made it depend on buildings.
- Fixed and expanded mercenaries.
- Slowed down recruitment pools and increased time it takes to recruit units to decrease spam and make it so you must plan getting units in advance.
- Added spiders back into the mod. (Not crashing)

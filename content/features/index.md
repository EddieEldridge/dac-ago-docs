### AI and Gameplay
#### **Campaign**

- Completely overhauled campaign AI with a focus on different faction/culture specific behaviour
- Pace has been slowed down overall allowing for longer campaigns where you try to complete the victory conditions without fighting endless spam from huge nations late game
- Difference between castles and cities is way bigger, castles replenish troops faster while making way less money than cities
- Aggression has been modified, changing how likely betrayal is depends on what kind of faction it is
- Overhauled diplomacy and faction standings
    - AA start neutral to everyone even as AI, but they generally dislike everyone and hate the Dunedain nations and Mordor
    - Made it basically impossible for the most lore breaking ceasefires/alliances/wars to happen
    - Factions that hate you often decline trade rights and map info
- Overhauled the economy such that cities make more money than castles, make generally a lot less income from taxes but get boosted income from trading, farming and mining (basically making getting economy buildings and capturing trading settlements more important)
- Tweaked custom generals so that nearly every faction has a good selection of custom generals at game start
- Allies will help way more and will often come to relieve a siege on one of your settlements
- Overhaul campaign map music with unique tracks selected carefully for each faction, cut and mixed beautifully courtesty of El Monstero
- Redone win conditions to include more lore-accurate targets and realistic goals
- Fixed and expanded mercenary pools
- Removed barracks event and made it be dependant on buildings instead
- Slowed down recruitment pools and increased the time it takes to recruit units to decrease spam and make it so you must think more carefully about what units you will recruit
- Adopted generals are always from 16-18 years old to fit better in family trees
- Changes to how culture spreads such as governors and spies now spreading culture
- Read script explanations in-game by pressing the mission button
- Added optional hardcore mode that adds in an army supply system and limits the use of autoresolve
- Overhauled the useless "Loyalty" attribute into "Ambition". Now it actually has effects such as helping with the supply traits, helping with combat and governor related skills and you need a minimum level for certain traits and ancillaries. Renown's effects also got a small boost to make it more meaningful
- New Military/Governor Education buildings and system for Gondor to train your new generals to increase their chance of getting education traits
- Reworked garrison script: Garrison units are always visible, no hidden spawns when you attack settlement. AI can use them if they sally or if you attack an army next to the settlement and to compensate. Player garrison's have been removed
- 'Free upkeep' values adjusted across the board to maintain balance
- More detailed unit stats such as speed and morale
- Paths have been re-added to the Misty Mountains, allowing for easier traversal for the factions here

#### **Battle**

- Battle AI Overhaul,
- Increased the health of gates/walls making it harder to capture settlements
- AI is more likely to defend the gates and walls
- AI is more likely to sally out when getting shot and flanked
- Removed focus on capturing plaza, AI knows this as well and focuses on fighting you instead of defending/attacking plaza
- AI now sits outside the range of towers until the gate is broken
- Added functional spiders back into the mod that no longer cause crashing
- New battle maps such as a brand new Dol Goldur map courtesy of Leo from TATW 4

### Scripts

#### Ring Script

- Rewritten and re-imagined ring script focusing on making the War of the Ring focused on the Ring like it should be
- Setup spy networks to find the location of the One Ring
- If Sauron takes the ring, Mordor and Dol Goldur will merge and all evil factions will get a boost to their economy
- Sauron is also now a force to be reckoned with if he finds the ring, raining fireballs from the sky and destroying tens of men with each swing of his mace
- AI can now destroy the ring and bring the ring to Sauron if not stopped
- Hold onto the ring yourself for a massive boost to your treasury while facing the wrath of the rest of Middle-earth
- AI can also choose to hold onto the ring with lore accurate chances for each faction
- For more information about the ring script, you can read it [here](https://discord.com/channels/759414542240972840/800365246522195988/800369046213623828)

#### Reunited Kingdom

#### Raiding

As an orc faction you can now stand on enemy territory to generate income, causing devastation (which is caused by standing on regions with farms built) which will keep increasing until it completes the cycle and resets, the trait description shows the amount of income being genearted from raiding.

#### Beacons of Gondor

3 Rohan armies spawn over the course of your Gondor campaign as long as you keep Rohan above 5 regions and in control of Edoras. Opposite also true: 3 Gondor armies can spawn for Rohan as long as you keep Gondor above 12 regions and in control of Minas Tirith

### Visuals

- Remade campaign map textures and models
- 53 new strategy map models with many thanks to Slave_knight_Olexandrius. Some factions will also automatically get different strategy map models based on the sub-race of the general (example HE Sindar-Noldor, Rhun Daritai-Balchoth-Arulad)
- Many new AA conscription troop textures for Rohan and Harad courtesty of Wicked
- Restore Mordor and heal the corruption allowing life to grow again and the map texture to change
- A bunch of new portraits for lots of factions courtesty of Naras
- New LOTR themed 'Ringbearer' font for many menu items, where appropriate
- Remasted UI menus for different cultures courtesty of Pythax

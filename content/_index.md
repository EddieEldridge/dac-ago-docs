### What is Divide and Conquer: AGO?
Divide and Conquer: AGO, AGO or 'AI and Gameplay Overhaul' is a submod for the submod [Divide and Conquer](https://www.moddb.com/mods/divide-and-conquer) which itself is a submod of [Third Age: Total War](https://www.moddb.com/mods/third-age-total-war) which is a mod for the historical strategy game [Medieval II: Total War](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4700/Total_War_MEDIEVAL_II__Definitive_Edition/).

AGO offers players a chance to control one of the many factions vying for control in Tolkien's Middle-earth during the period of the "War of the Ring".

From the desperate Dúnedain in the cold North to the Haradrim in the blazing South and everywhere in-between, the only thing standing in your way is your imagination. Featuring over 26 unique factions and 500 different fully modelled, animated and voiced units, AGO offers a unique take on the classic Divide and Conquer experience.

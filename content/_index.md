### What is Divide and Conquer: AGO?
Divide and Conquer: AGO, AGO or 'AI and Gameplay Overhaul' is a submod for the submod [Divide and Conquer](https://www.moddb.com/mods/divide-and-conquer) which itself is a submod of [Third Age: Total War](https://www.moddb.com/mods/third-age-total-war) which is a mod for the historical strategy game [Medieval II: Total War](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4700/Total_War_MEDIEVAL_II__Definitive_Edition/).

From the desperate Dúnedain in the cold North to the Haradrim in the blazing South, AGO offers players a chance to control one of the many factions vying for control in Tolkien's Middle-earth during the period of the "War of the Ring".

The level of dedication to this great game and modset, on top of the love for LOTR, I couldn't be happier I stumbled onto this project. I'm not sure I can go back to different versions of Third Age: Total War at this rate, it's AGO or bust moving forward for me. This mod is peak and we're spoiled rotten to have it.

Just wanted to say the fully-upgraded RK Dunedain tree units (specifically, the Dol Amroth upgrades) look terrific. I was skeptical when I saw the unit card, but was really impressed when I saw the units on the battle map.

I played AGO as much in the last three weeks as if it were an important project in a job. With a gap of more than two years you notice also the development of the mods in detail. Therefore, all of my campaigns were immersive, exciting and stable  (not one battle chrash btw), the Middle-Earth atmosphere is simply captured in a great way and the potential of a story is awakened.

So I just wanted to thank you all for this amazing mod, I'm not new to this at all but I just realized I never took the time to give you some feedback. I think this mod is absolutely amazing, there are few games I can get so many hours in without getting bored. I think everyone who works on this mod is incredibly talented and please don't stop working on it anytime soon

I just love the new Ring Script! It always annoyed me that in the vanilla DaC Mod, Isengard wasnt capable as an AI to obtain the Ring. But AGO just made it all more interesting. It can be destroyed from good factions, every faciton can be corrupted and keep it, evil factions give it to Sauron and isengard and their allies give it to Saruman. I am impressed!

Just wanted to say Ive started a Rangers of the north campaign and just the first 10 turns so far but the story and script direction makes so much more sense now! Really enjoying it so far!

Playing a KD expedition campaign and I'm having an amazing time because of AGO.

In particular, the recruitment rates feel like I'm relying on dwarves traveling to the spearhead I've made into the misty mountains. Every new unit feels desperately needed and smart use of the units I do have is the only thing keeping me alive.

You've nailed the unique situation the KD found themselves in the movie and book. Surrounded by wealth but lacking the manpower needed to leverage it.

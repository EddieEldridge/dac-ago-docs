"The heady vintage of the great gardens of Dorwinion... a land of vines in 'the burning South.'" - Little known information on Dorwinion

### Starting Location
Dorwinion is located in the eastern reaches of Rhovanion, bordered by the mountains and sea of Rhûn. Both of these natural features provide Dorwinion some protection from their Easterling neighbours. They begin with their capital; The Garden City (Caras Sant), the castle of the Western Gardens (Sant Annui) and the City of the Coastal Folk (Strondost).

### Early Game
There are plenty of independent towns and castles in the wide grasslands of Rhovanion and Logathavuld that Dorwinion can easily claim before they need resort to all out war. The Darïtaï of Rhûn, being Dorwinion's nearest neighbour, start on neutral terms with the lands of wine and may not bring conflict in the early game. Beyond the Easterlings, the men of Dale and the Dwarves of Erebor hold as steadfast allies to the north.

### Starting Location
Dorwinion is located in the eastern reaches of Rhovanion, bordered by the mountains and sea of Rhûn. Both of these natural features provide Dorwinion some protection from their Easterling neighbours. They begin with their capital; The Garden City (Caras Sant), the castle of the Western Gardens (Sant Annui) and the City of the Coastal Folk (Strondost).

### Campaign Events

- The premise is Dale is asking for help to rebuild now that they feel the threat of the Easterlings, the council wants to help them while the nobles and merchants want to keep their profits.
    - Accepting will give you a significant kings purse loss, normal replenishment rate for elves, access to top tier smithing, construction time reduced faction wide, instant war with Rhun and some rebellious Nobles in your heartlands.
    - Declining will give you great trade bonuses, half replenishment for elves and so-so relations with both Dale and Rhun (Rhun will probably still attack you, this is not an evil/good choice, but the player does have a chance to choose to go evil if he tries to ally them with a tempting offer during this time period) and construction costs reduced faction wide

- As a mostly mercenary faction you will have low amounts of free upkeep units.

### Early Game
There are plenty of independent towns and castles in the wide grasslands of Rhovanion and Logathavuld that Dorwinion can easily claim before they need resort to all out war. The Darïtaï of Rhûn, being Dorwinion's nearest neighbour, start on neutral terms with the lands of wine and may not bring conflict in the early game. Beyond the Easterlings, the men of Dale and the Dwarves of Erebor hold as steadfast allies to the north.

### Military Overview
Dorwinion have a unique military that depends upon the choices their ruling council and Vine-Regent take, predominantly though they are a medium-armoured infantry faction, with good ranged units and lots of variety. They have some solid cavalry and if the Elves are brought to bear, they have some formidable elite troops.

### Description
Some will tell you that Bree is old.

Older than the Shire. Older than Minas Tirith. Older than Fornost. Older than the Havens. They tell that there has been a settlement here, on the Road, since the First Age of the World. And the Road passing through the Bree-land is ancient, for it was made by the Firstborn, long, long ago, when they passed this way heading West.

For others Bree is younger, as they say that the Men of Bree are cousins to the Dunlendings, a folk of Men that long ago dwelt in distant dales in the far south and that eventually moved north, to live in the foothills of the Misty Mountains.

Of course, if you ask a Bree-lander most of the above is just pointless chatter. Bree-hill has always been there, and if you want to know about history, you will be regaled with an infinitely detailed recounting of village gossip, marriages, births, deaths, things said in the taproom of The Pony, things not said when they should have been said, and so forth.

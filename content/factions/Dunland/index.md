### Description
In times long past and ill-remembered, shrouded in legend and mystery, the black tower was ruled by the Númenóreans. Today, it is held by the Wise One. Saruman. He sends us greetings, and gifts of blade and shield to our Gurach's hall.
He wishes to be our friend, so his emissaries claim, and sees the great injustices done to us by the Forgoil as debt in dire need of repayment.

The men that bring his word are of the Isendraich, a tribe of mix-bloods that dwell around and even inside his walls. They are keen-minded and knowledgeable, and make for good advisors to any Brehin, and the Gurach too. In exchange for sword and shield and wisdom, Saruman asks only that we send him our warriors to fight in Rohan, and for him to be allowed to build places where his followers can dwell, and our warriors can come to be equipped.

The Brehins rejoice at this. It is what our men would do anyway, so why not take the steel to simply do what we do, but with better tools? They may not be wrong. The Huntsmasters grumble, though. They say the Wise One uses his silver tongue to make us think he wishes only for our strength, when truly he hungers for our spirit. They say they won’t offer their guidance to Brehins that allow the White Hands banner to fly next to their Crebain.

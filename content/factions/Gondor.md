"Believe not that in the land of Gondor the blood of Númenor is spent, nor all its pride and dignity forgotten. By our valour the wild folk of the East are still restrained, and the terror of Morgul kept at bay; and thus alone are peace and freedom maintained in the lands behind us, bulwark of the West. But if the passages of the River should be won, what then?" - Gondor's strength and problem 

### Starting Location
Gondor has many natural defences against her enemies: the Anduin protects from the hordes of Mordor, Khand and Harad and; the Ered Nimrais gives cover from the nations of Enedwaith. She is also the largest nation in Middle-earth and the potential of her economic strength is certainly comforting.

### Early Game
Mordor dominates Gondor's entire campaign and the opening days of the War of the Ring are no different. There are few independent holds in these embattled lands and Mordor will arrive at the ruins of Osgiliath within a few years. Gondor must mobilise her enormous strength quickly and strike fast before Sauron can bring Harad, Khand and his own hordes to full production. All hope is not lost however for Prince Adrahil commands many battalions of elite warriors from Dol Amroth and he has been tasked with holding the Mouths of the Anduin.

### Military Overview
Gondor is a nation of heavy infantry and skilled armourers, and even its lowest tier warriors boast well-made armour and arms. The famous White Tree is emblazoned on fine plate mail and the sight of a fully equipped Gondorian army arrayed on the field will give pause to any would-be foe. The cavalry of Gondor is few and far between however and is not the favoured method of combat for the Númenórean descendants.

I just wanted to take the time to thank everyone working on the mod! It's quiet a master piece and i'm enjoying it a lot! Thank you guys a lot for the hard work!<div class=username>petitpoucet</div></div><div class=speechbubble>The level of dedication to this great game and modset, on top of the love for LOTR, I couldn't be happier I stumbled onto this project. I'm not sure I can go back to different versions of Third Age: Total War at this rate, it's AGO or bust moving forward for me. This mod is peak and we're spoiled rotten to have it.<div class=username>TinyTim</div></div><div class=speechbubble>Just wanted to say the fully-upgraded RK Dunedain tree units (specifically, the Dol Amroth upgrades) look terrific. I was skeptical when I saw the unit card, but was really impressed when I saw the units on the battle map.<div class=username>martingale</div></div><div class=speechbubble>You guys are amazing. I was just telling my wife how much I love this and how much effort has gone in. I thought I'd tell you all too.<div class=username>joycey17</div></div><div class=speechbubble>I played AGO as much in the last three weeks as if it were an important project in a job. With a gap of more than two years you notice also the development of the mods in detail. Therefore, all of my campaigns were immersive, exciting and stable (not one battle chrash btw), the Middle-Earth atmosphere is simply captured in a great way and the potential of a story is awakened.<div class=username>Saalpeter</div></div><div class=speechbubble>Just wanna say I'm playing AA and the rohan units with the AA colours look amazing, Like the royal guard but AA colours looks so damn good<div class=username>Hello There</div></div><div class=speechbubble>So I just wanted to thank you all for this amazing mod, I'm not new to this at all but I just realized I never took the time to give you some feedback. I think this mod is absolutely amazing, there are few games I can get so many hours in without getting bored. I think everyone who works on this mod is incredibly talented and please don't stop working on it anytime soon<div class=username>titan1523</div></div><div class=speechbubble>Hey guys just wanted to thank you for the mod, been playing the hell out of it since I took the time to sink my teeth in it and it's just great<div class=username>blackbird</div></div><div class=speechbubble>Just started a campaign with Dunland, and absolutely terrific job with the soundtrack! I got goosebumps listening to one of the tunes<div class=username>Naitheg</div></div><div class=speechbubble>Wonderful mod, any problems I had where quickly solved by either Fynn or the community<div class=username>BarrZ</div></div><div class=speechbubble>The new custom battle screen is dope af<div class=username>Tasorodri</div></div><div class=speechbubble>Brother this mod is so beautiful Im so addicted 2 it such a good submod<div class=username>SHQP465</div></div><div class=speechbubble>Sir, what an amazing mod of an amazing mod. I salute you.<div class=username>Rincewind</div></div><div class=speechbubble>Just wanted to stop in and say this is a great mod, I've been playing DaC off and on since it came out years ago and AGO has been a great experience. Thanks!<div class=username>Krys</div></div><div class=speechbubble>The RK and AA remodels are both exquisite.<div class=username>Toe-Knee</div></div><div class=speechbubble>I just love the new Ring Script! It always annoyed me that in the vanilla DaC Mod, Isengard wasnt capable as an AI to obtain the Ring. But AGO just made it all more interesting. It can be destroyed from good factions, every faciton can be corrupted and keep it, evil factions give it to Sauron and isengard and their allies give it to Saruman. I am impressed!<div class=username>GOTisbestAnime</div></div><div class=speechbubble>Just wanted to say Ive started a Rangers of the north campaign and just the first 10 turns so far but the story and script direction makes so much more sense now! Really enjoying it so far!<div class=username>Crackers</div></div><div class=speechbubble>Playing a KD expedition campaign and I'm having an amazing time because of AGO.<p>In particular, the recruitment rates feel like I&rsquo;m relying on dwarves traveling to the spearhead I&rsquo;ve made into the misty mountains. Every new unit feels desperately needed and smart use of the units I do have is the only thing keeping me alive.</p><p>You&rsquo;ve nailed the unique situation the KD found themselves in the movie and book. Surrounded by wealth but lacking the manpower needed to leverage it.</p><div class=username>Noahqshark</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></main></div></body></html>

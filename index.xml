Both of these natural features provide Dorwinion some protection from their Easterling neighbours. They begin with their capital; The Garden City (Caras Sant), the castle of the Western Gardens (Sant Annui) and the City of the Coastal Folk (Strondost).
Campaign Events The premise is Dale is asking for help to rebuild now that they feel the threat of the Easterlings, the council wants to help them while the nobles and merchants want to keep their profits.</description></item><item><title>Download</title><link>https://www.divide-and-conquer-ago.com/download/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.divide-and-conquer-ago.com/download/</guid><description>Download Links Google Drive Mediafire Installation Quickstart Install a clean copy of Divide and Conquer 4.6 Make a copy of your Divide_and_Conquer folder located in Medieval II Total War/mods Rename it Divide_and_Conquer_ago Drag the contents of the DaC AGO V2 - War of the Ring Beta folder in the downloaded zip archive into your own Divide_and_Conquer_ago folder, replacing if prompted Navigate to Medieval II Total War/mods/Divide_and_Conquer_ago and double click the file Full Cleaner.</description></item><item><title>F.A.Q</title><link>https://www.divide-and-conquer-ago.com/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.divide-and-conquer-ago.com/faq/</guid><description>Frequently Asked Questions Game won&amp;rsquo;t start and/or M2TWEOP (Medieval 2 Engine Overhaul Project) get&amp;rsquo;s detected as a virus The Engine Overhaul often gets detected as a Trojan by windows defender or anti-virus. To be able to play with it enabled you need to make an exclusion to the mod folder The reason it gets detected is because it works by modifying the memory of another program when you run it (Medieval 2), which is similar to what some malicious programs would do to other programs you don&amp;rsquo;t want it to happen to.</description></item><item><title>Features</title><link>https://www.divide-and-conquer-ago.com/features/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.divide-and-conquer-ago.com/features/</guid><description>AI and Gameplay Campaign Completely overhauled campaign AI with a focus on different faction/culture specific behavior Pace has been slowed down overall allowing for longer campaigns where you try to complete the victory conditions without fighting endless spam from huge nations late game Difference between castles and cities is way bigger, castles replenish troops faster while making way less money than cities Aggression has been modified, changing how likely betrayal is depends on what kind of faction it is Overhauled diplomacy and faction standings AA start neutral to everyone even as AI, but they generally dislike everyone and hate the Dunedain nations and Mordor Made it basically impossible for the most lore breaking ceasefires/alliances/wars to happen Factions that hate you often decline trade rights and map info Overhauled the economy such that cities make more money than castles, make generally a lot less income from taxes but get boosted income from trading, farming and mining (basically making getting economy buildings and capturing trading settlements more important) Tweaked custom generals so that nearly every faction has a good selection of custom generals at game start Allies will help way more and will often come to relieve a siege on one of your settlements Overhaul campaign map music with unique tracks selected carefully for each faction, cut and mixed beautifully courtesy of El Monstero Redone win conditions to include more lore-accurate targets and realistic goals Fixed and expanded mercenary pools Removed barracks event and made it be dependant on buildings instead Slowed down recruitment pools and increased the time it takes to recruit units to decrease spam and make it so you must think more carefully about what units you will recruit Adopted generals are always from 16-18 years old to fit better in family trees Changes to how culture spreads such as governors and spies now spreading culture Read script explanations in-game by pressing the mission button Added optional hardcore mode that adds in an army supply system and limits the use of autoresolve Overhauled the useless &amp;ldquo;Loyalty&amp;rdquo; attribute into &amp;ldquo;Ambition&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Unit Gallery</title><link>https://www.divide-and-conquer-ago.com/model/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.divide-and-conquer-ago.com/model/</guid><description> Background Mordor Dorwinion Minas Tirith Dunland Ered Luin Umbar Bree Fangorn Black Unit Model Ruffians (1) Ruffians (2) Ruffians (3) Brehin's Oathband (1) Brehin's Oathband (2) Brehin's Oathband (3) Huntmasters (1) Huntmasters (2)</description></item></channel></rss>
